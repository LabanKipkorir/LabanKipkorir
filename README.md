- 👋 Hi, I’m @LabanKipkorir
- 👀 I’m interested in **cracking the code on AI** 🤖, making beautiful (and fast!) **web apps** 🕸️, and exploring anything that requires a lot of *coffee* ☕.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the dark arts of **advanced data structures** and trying to make my first **full-stack project** look professionally designed (wish me luck! 🎨).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **anything involving Python 🐍 or modern JavaScript** that doesn't *completely* break my brain. Small, impactful projects highly encouraged!
- 📫 How to reach me: Drop me a line! You can find my digital pigeon carrier here: *labankipkorirkemboi@gmail.com**.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe that **Ctrl+Z** is the most powerful spell in any programmer's arsenal, and I frequently use it in real life (it never works). 🪄
